# TDD feedback

Get feedback on your unit tests -- if you're trying to do TDD on something and the tests hurt too much to write or maintain, 
post some code snippets and explain the context in a [new issue in this repository](https://github.com/gojko/tdd-feedback/issues/new), Iâ€™ll do my best to offer some clear actionable advice on how to improve it. 

Check out my post on [Alice in the Hall of Mirrors](https://gojko.net/2018/01/23/alice-in-the-hall-of-mirrors.html) for what inspired this.
